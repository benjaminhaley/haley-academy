I have several indoor plants, but the experience is not the same.

The instrument responsible for this sound is the <i>antara</i>, or Andean panpipe, known for the hollow-sounding, breathy notes it creates. The antara has its origins in the Incan civilization, once <span class='qtwo'>the more richer and more</span>  powerful empire in South America.</p><p>The antara consists of a connected row of hollow, vertical pipes of varying lengths, <span class='qthree'>which are then lined up.</span> The pipes, which can vary <span class='qfour'>numerously</span> from three to fifteen, are fashioned from clay that is rolled around a mold. Each pipe is individually rolled to create the proper pitch before <span class='qfive'>being bound</span> to the other pipes.</p><p>The antara dates back to the ninth century. Evidence about how musicians played the instrument <span class='qsix'>have come</span> from painted images on Incan ceramic pottery. Musicians are depicted playing a six-pipe antara by holding the lower ends of the two longer pipes with the right hand while placing the left hand near the <span class='qseven'>remaining</span> tops of the four pipes. The antara was also sometimes held in one hand while the other hand <span class='qeight'>beat</span> a cylindrical drum.</p><p>[1] Due to the limited number of notes that can be played on an <span class='qnine'>antara, early musicians’</span> most likely worked in groups, coordinating the timing and pitch of their instruments to extend the range of sounds produced.  <span class='box'>10</span> [2] Other pottery images show two antara players facing each other while dancing. [3] Each player holds a set of pipes <span class='qeleven'>so that both sets are</span> connected to the other set by  a string, as if to suggest that those two antaras should be played together. [4] Even to this day, descendants of the Incas, the Quechua people of Peru and Bolivia, prefer to play matched antaras bound together. <span class='box'>12</span></p><p>Unfortunately, the music of the Incas can probably never be <span class='thirteen'>exactly re-creating.</span> Yet one can <span class='fourteen'>hear in the music of their descendants,</span> beautiful variations on a musical sound that has survived for many centuries. <span class='box'>15</span></p></div>"
